## Mental Health Insights on Working Environment based on Stack Overflow 2022 Survey Analysis.

I analyze the Stack Overflow 2022 survey results dataset related to mental health in the workplace, answering six key questions related to the prevalence of mental health. I provide statistical and visual insights into the findings through plots, highlighting variations in the prevalence of mental health issues based on location, work model, developer type, organization size, and age. The analysis demonstrates the importance of prioritizing mental health programs in the workplace and supporting the workforce's overall well-being.

The calculations for these statistics were done with a confidence level of 95%, meaning that there is a high probability (95%) that the true value of the population parameter lies within the estimated range. Itâ€™s important to note that in the remaining 5% of cases, the estimated range may not include the true value of the parameter.

Are there any suggestions for improvement or anything important that we might have overlooked? I invite you to share your thoughts by leaving a comment below or opening a pull request on this GitHub repository. Alternatively, you can reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luccas-perone/).

I would greatly appreciate your feedback on my analysis. Together, we can enhance the quality of our work and achieve better results.
